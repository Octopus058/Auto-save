# Auto save 5mins

Save your projects automatically :>

</div>

## Why?

One night, while coding, I typed the code and forgot to save it, so I didn't notice that my computer was running out of battery. At the moment of shutting down, all my work was **in vain**. To prevent tragedies from happening again, I wrote a simple extension ```Auto save 5mins``` that **automatically saves the code every 5 minutes**.

## How?

Really nothing to do, The only thing you need to do is just **subscribe to this extension in VScode extension market**. You asked me then what? Go ahead and type your code **trustingly**!

See below ðŸ‘‡

## Next?

Hmm... I didn't expect there to be any room for updates. If there are any problems, please submit your **issues**. Thank you very much!
