## Why?

One evening, while coding, the author inadvertently forgot to save for an extended period, and the computer unexpectedly shut down, rendering all the work useless. Consequently, the author intends to develop an extension that automatically saves codes at scheduled intervals.

## How?

Really nothing to do, the code is automatically saved every five minutes after enabling this extension.
